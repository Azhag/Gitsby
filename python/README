=======

This folder should contain helper scripts, or anything that could be relevant for Python.

Think about specific plots manipulations, or data loading/handling.

These programs output a plot in /tmp/plot.pdf by default.

utils.py -- Random collection of simple useful functions. Contains some plotting, some math, some fitting and others. (LM)
dataio.py -- Simple class to save variables and figures to disk. Handles random filenames, and writes Git informations along with the variables and into the metadata of the figures directly. You'll never forget which version of the code you used to generate figures with now :)
