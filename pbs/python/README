Python scripts for PBS

These are a few classes or functions for sending simulations to PBS and then load them back.

feed/feeder -- queue up jobs locally and feed them slowly into PBS.  PBS
(currently) cannot deal with too many jobs at a time. feeder will trickle jobs
into the PBS queue so that you do not have too many jobs on the queue.
feed adds jobs to your local queue.  the typical usage is to run 'feeder' on
your gatsby machine in a screen, then use 'feed' instead of 'qsub'.
first you must create the directory ~/runq/incoming/
